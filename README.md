This repository contains the experimental design, which uses a dribble layout as the basis, and the idea is to apply various React Universe technologies. Below are the technologies I'm currently using.

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/)
- [Redux Saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/)
- [React Moment](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-moment)
